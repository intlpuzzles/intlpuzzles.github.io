  <h1>Welcome To My Website Goldmnadf Scahcs</h1>
  <p>Before the internet became all this 70mm HDR Smoothskin Minimalist Aesthetic Shop Like A Billionaire DeepDream slop it was pages like this one where regular people which is to say computer enthusiasts wrote html pages that they shared with their friends. I can't say I'm a computer enthusiast myself considering I just made this github account and I forgot the command for exiting vim but I still admire the community which is to say I want to make a page like they did in the old days, with links and text and that's pretty much it.  
  
  Maybe there will be a visitor counter at the bottom</p>
